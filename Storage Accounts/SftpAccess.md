### SFTP Credentials
Attackers may obtain and abuse credentials of an SFTP account as a means of gaining initial access. SFTP is a prevalent file transfer protocol between a client and a remote service. Once the user connects to the cloud storage service, the user can upload and download blobs and perform other operations that are supported by the protocol. SFTP connection requires SFTP accounts which are managed locally in the storage service instance, including credentials in a form of passwords or key-pairs.

### Detection 
Any access using SFTP  
```
StorageBlobLogs  
| where Protocol=="SFTP"
| where StatusCode==200
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, Protocol, OperationName, AuthenticationType, StatusCode, StatusText, Uri, CallerIpAddress, UserAgentHeader, RequesterObjectId
```
Access using localuserpassword  
```
StorageBlobLogs  
| where Protocol=="SFTP"
| where StatusCode==200
| where AuthenticationType=="LocalUserPassword"
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, Protocol, OperationName, AuthenticationType, StatusCode, StatusText, Uri, CallerIpAddress, UserAgentHeader, RequesterObjectId
```
Attackers may use storage services to store a malicious program or toolset that will be executed at later times during their operation. In addition, adversaries may exploit the trust between users and their organizationâ€™s Storage services by storing phishing content. Furthermore, storage services can be leveraged to park gathered intelligence that will be exfiltrated when terms suit the actor group.
